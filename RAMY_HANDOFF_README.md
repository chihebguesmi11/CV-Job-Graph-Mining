# RAMY'S DELIVERABLES - HANDOFF POINT

## ✅ Completed Tasks (Phase 1-2)

### Data Files Created:
- `data/cvs.json` - 100 CVs with all attributes
- `data/cvs_with_graphs.json` - CVs with internal skill graphs
- `data/cv_job_graph.pkl` - Initial bipartite graph structure (CV nodes only)
- `data/graph_statistics.json` - Initial graph statistics

### Results Generated:
- `results/metrics/cv_skill_communities.csv` - CV skill community metrics
- `results/figures/skill_graph_examples.png` - Example skill graphs

## 📤 Ready for Chiheb:

1. **Graph File**: `data/cv_job_graph.pkl`
   - Contains 100 CV nodes with all attributes
   - Ready for Job node addition
   - Need ~175 edges total after Job integration

2. **CV Data**: `data/cvs.json` or `data/cvs_with_graphs.json`
   - Use for generating CV embeddings
   - All CV attributes available

## ⏳ Waiting for from Chiheb:

1. Updated `data/cv_job_graph.pkl` with:
   - 80 Job nodes added
   - ~175 initial CV-Job edges

2. `data/cv_embeddings.npy`
   - Embeddings for all 100 CVs
   - Needed for Phase 4 classification

## 🔄 Next Steps After Handoff:

Once Chiheb provides the above:
1. Run Phase 2B: Global community detection
2. Continue with Phases 3-6
